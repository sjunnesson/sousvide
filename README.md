-------------

[Solid state relay]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HZN628/ref=oh_details_o05_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  
[Heatsink](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005D6145G/ref=oh_details_o05_s01_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  
[DS18B20](temperature probe http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HODWBU/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  
4,7k resistor  
[Arduino Duemilanove](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove)  
The heating source is a slow cooker of basically any "dumb" type. No digital controlls just a "Low, High" heat setting that turns on and off if you pull the plug out from the wall.  



Feel free to fork, reuse and play with it.
